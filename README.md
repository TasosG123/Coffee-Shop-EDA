# Coffee-Shop-EDA
EDA of a kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedabbas757/coffee-sales/)
This project was completed by me (Anastasios Georgiou), Nikos Petrou and Vasilis Smirliadis as part of the Data Analytics bootcamp by Big Blue Data Academy.

Premise: We want to open a coffee shop and we analyze the data from a competitor.
Findings: In terms of location, each of the three is the about the same based on total sales. So in order to choose a location for our coffe shop we need more data such as rent for our property.
          For our employees, we must schedule more shifts in the mornings (rush hour) and maybe run a promotion to attract more customers in the evenings.
          Lastly, because our initial budget is small, we are going to start with only four product categories based on the sales of our competitor (baker, coffee, drinking chocolate and tea).
